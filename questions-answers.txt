1. Using create-react-app, what do we need to set up for testing?
    We need to import required modules to test components, but is not necessary to install additional to get started. "create-react-app" contains jest which allows us to test.

2. What components are worth to test in your development?
    Those with key role in the development.

3. Can you apply TDD once you already created components?
    I think so, sounds like an iterative process to improve component's quality.
